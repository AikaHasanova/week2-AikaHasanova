# Command Line Arg

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* Starting from a blank Python file, create a Python application that takes in two command line arguments and checks if they are equal. If the two numbers are equal then output: "True". Otherwise output: "False".

### Bonuses

* Check if the two numbers are both multiples of 7. Again output "True" if they are and output "False" if they are not.
